# The Influence of Weather and Road Conditions on Road Accident Severity

## Overview
The project involves thorough exploratory data analysis, data preparation including cleaning, outlier removal, data encoder, followed by the development of robust machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, L-GBM, MLP). By systematically exploring the interplay between weather, road conditions, and accident severity, this project aims to address this gap by assessing the severity of road accidents across various classes, including fatal, hospitalization, medical treatment, minor injury, and property damage, attributing them to weather and road conditions. Additionally, it aims to provide valuable insights for enhancing road safety measures and reducing the toll of road accidents on public health and infrastructure.
